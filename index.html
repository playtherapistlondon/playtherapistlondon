  <p>Hello, I’m Havva Tepegoz Yetkincan, a BPS-approved Psychologist and PTUK-approved Therapeutic Play Practitioner based in London. I am fully DBS checked and ICO registered, ensuring safe, ethical, and confidential practice for every child and family I work with.</p>
  <p>With extensive training in non-directive play therapy, trauma-informed care, and culturally sensitive interventions, I am passionate about supporting children's emotional well-being and development through play. I am a fully qualified Therapeutic Play Practitioner. My practice is grounded in creating a safe, empathetic, and child-centered environment where children can express, explore, and process their feelings through the power of play. I work closely with families to offer individualized support that promotes emotional regulation, resilience, and healthy relationships.</p>
  <p>Located in London, I offer individual play therapy sessions, group therapy, and parental consultations. My approach combines evidence-based techniques with compassionate care, while maintaining the highest standards of professional and ethical practice.</p>

  <h2>FAQs – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="flex">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Who is Play Therapy suitable for?</h3>
      <p>Play Therapy is suitable for children aged 3-11 who may be experiencing emotional, behavioural, or social challenges. This includes children dealing with anxiety, trauma, loss, attachment difficulties, or difficulties in peer relationships.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>How many sessions are typically required?</h3>
      <p>Each child’s therapeutic needs are unique. While some children may benefit from short-term interventions (e.g. 12 sessions), others may require longer-term support. The duration of therapy is regularly reviewed and discussed with parents or carers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do parents participate in the sessions?</h3>
      <p>In non-directive play therapy, sessions are held individually with the child. However, parental involvement is a crucial part of the overall process. Regular parent review meetings are arranged to discuss the child’s progress and offer support for the family.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>How are sessions planned?</h3>
      <p>Sessions follow a non-directive, child-led approach. The therapy room is equipped with a variety of therapeutic play materials, including art, clay, a sand tray, role-play, puppets, and storytelling tools, allowing the child to express themselves freely and safely.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Is everything my child shares confidential?</h3>
      <p>Yes. All information shared during sessions is treated with strict confidentiality. However, if any safeguarding concerns arise regarding the child’s safety or wellbeing, relevant information may be shared in line with safeguarding policies and legal obligations.</p>
